# Web-Scraping-and-Analysis


Project Title: Web Scraping and Analysis of GeeksforGeeks Website

Description: In this project, I developed a Python script using the BeautifulSoup, requests, pandas, and matplotlib libraries to extract information from the GeeksforGeeks website. Specifically, I scraped the website's HTML to obtain the page title, paragraphs of text, links, and anchor tags. Using pandas, I then created a DataFrame to count the number of links in each paragraph and generated a bar chart to visualize the results. This project demonstrates my proficiency in web scraping and data analysis using Python.
